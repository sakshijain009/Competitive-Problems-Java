# Graphs
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).

The two most common ways to represent graphs are :
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

## Hamiltonian Cycle
Hamiltonian Cycle or Circuit in a graph G is a cycle that visits every vertex of G exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.

## Hamiltonian Path
Hamiltonian Path in a graph G is a path that visits every vertex of G exactly once and Hamiltonian Path doesn’t have to return to the starting vertex. It’s an open path.
